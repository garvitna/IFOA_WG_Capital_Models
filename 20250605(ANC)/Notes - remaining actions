1)  inputs
- adjust for online resources where applicable (AON and LCP analysis) - GN parameters - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC - DONE) 
-add source links/reference to what was used to calibrate parameters - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC - DONE)
- update starting assets to 7-8bn - WILL UPDATED AFTER AC REVIEWS INSURANCE RISK PARAMETERS 
- set up YELTs for Cat risk - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC)
- Reserve risk parameters to be adjusted (lognormal)
- Increase the copula input parameters to get a similar Capital figure


2)Methodology:
-ensure SCR is broadly equal for all models - WILL UPDATED AFTER AC REVIEWS INSURANCE RISK PARAMETERS
- ensure all marginals method calcs are the same between copulas and risk drivers (cover market risk in both) - DONE
- set up hybrid model (copulas without inflation) - DONE
- adjust reserve risk calculation to use market standard approach (base run off, incurred, paid) - DONE
- YELTs to use for cat risk - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC) - DONE
- Economic risk driver should apply to UW risk and not Reserve risk
- Market risk needs to include Credit spread risk need

3) outputs 
- set up comparison outputs (% difference etc) - DONE (adjust so that this is produced as an output in excel format)
- diversification metric - AC TO REVIEW
-1 in 10 and earlier return periods (for all risks) - VAR AND TVAR ALREADY PUBLISHED FOR 90TH PERCENTILE
- label plots and charts - CDFs HAVE BEEN LABELLED - DONE
- Ensure SCR to premium ratio is reasonable - i.e., would expect SCR=2bn for a 5-6bn premium company (Add this ratio to the MI produced)
- show comparison of individual risks for each model - e.g., reserve risk, large claims and all the granular (for drivers models would be good to show pre and post drivers, i.e., pre inflation and post inflation large claims)


4) Model code clean up:
- correct issue with show cdf function issue with titles - refresh in version 2 - THIS IS WORKING AFTER CORRECTION IN STOCHASTIC SCALER PCM MODULE


5) Validation:
- clean up methodology and code (JN)
- once the model is finalised:
  - check the contribution to SCR from each major risk to ensure that is reasonable (Expectation is total UW and reserve risk would make up most of SCR - c80% (35% reserve and 45% UW risk)  the rest would be split in ops, market and credit risk)
  - review the JEPs 

6) Working paper (Egress):
- paste the reuslts in the modelling section
- set out the practical steps to access and run the model (pcm packages, scripts, excel outputs etc.,)
- explain the approach (E.g., three models copulas, hybrid, drivers - aim to show the difference in modelling, keep results consistent across all, use similar inputs, model medium/large size specialty insurer, add disclaimer for results/illustration purposes only)
- high level comment on results

Pending actions:
- share results with the group (week com 3th June) (DONE - ANC)
- adjust the models in light of any  group feedback
- keep updating the working paper for the modelling work, results, commentary and instructions
- Methodology issues
    -large and attritional losses quite material
    - lack of dependency in drivers model
    - TVAR calculation for drivers model doesn't add up (i.e., reserve+UW +..  is not equal to combined)
- Review parameters to ensure consistency across risk areas and benchmarking
- Code clean up/ merge and make efficient where possible (inputs that are the same for all models could go in the same s/sheet)
- Adjust comparison script to produce all plots and tables needed for the paper (currently some of the visuals are not exported in excel, also missing the contribution to capital figures)
