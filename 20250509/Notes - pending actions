#pending actions
1)  inputs
- adjust for online resources where applicable (AON and LCP analysis) - GN parameters - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC - DONE) 
-add source links/reference to what was used to calibrate parameters - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC - DONE)
- update starting assets to 7-8bn - WILL UPDATED AFTER AC REVIEWS INSURANCE RISK PARAMETERS 
- set up YELTs for Cat risk - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC)
- Reserve risk parameters to be adjusted (lognormal)


2)Methodology:
-ensure SCR is broadly equal for all models - WILL UPDATED AFTER AC REVIEWS INSURANCE RISK PARAMETERS
- ensure all marginals method calcs are the same between copulas and risk drivers (cover market risk in both) - DONE
- set up hybrid model (copulas without inflation) - DONE
- adjust reserve risk calculation to use market standard approach (base run off, incurred, paid) - DONE
- YELTs to use for cat risk - DONE (REVIEW PENDING WITH AC) - DONE
- Economic risk driver should apply to UW risk and not Reserve risk
- Market risk needs to include Credit spread risk need

3) outputs 
- set up comparison outputs (% difference etc) - DONE (adjust so that this is produced as an output in excel format)
- diversification metric - AC TO REVIEW
-1 in 10 and earlier return periods (for all risks) - VAR AND TVAR ALREADY PUBLISHED FOR 90TH PERCENTILE
- label plots and charts - CDFs HAVE BEEN LABELLED - DONE


4) Model code clean up:
- correct issue with show cdf function issue with titles - refresh in version 2 - THIS IS WORKING AFTER CORRECTION IN STOCHASTIC SCALER PCM MODULE


5) Validation:
- clean up methodology and code (JN)

6) Working paper (Egress):
- paste the reuslts in the modelling section
- set out the practical steps to access and run the model (pcm packages, scripts, excel outputs etc.,)
- explain the approach (E.g., three models copulas, hybrid, drivers - aim to show the difference in modelling, keep results consistent across all, use similar inputs, model medium/large size specialty insurer, add disclaimer for results/illustration purposes only)
- high level comment on results

Pending actions:
- share results with the group (week com 3th June)
- adjust the models in light of any  group feedback
- fill in the working paper for the model work
